# Bowling_Script

Welcome to the bowling script!

To begin, import the script from the repo. then simply run it with "python bowling_script.py"

It will ask you how many players will be playing (from 1-6 players) and to provide a name for each player. You will then provide how many frames you want to play. Then it begins!

For each frame, it will ask your score on your roll. You can enter 'x' if you rolled a strike, a number followed by a space and '/" for a spare or 2 space delimited numbers for any other score.

At the end, the winner will be crowned by the highest scoring player.
